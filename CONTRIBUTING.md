Hi! If you think of a feature that needs to be in virtual-assistant, or think a certain phrase should be mapped to a different function, feel free to make a PR!

### Contributing Guidelines
* Try to cover as many possible phrases as you can, or that are applicable;

* Mimic the format of other functions in the file (naming conventions, etc)

* Don't forget to test!

### Contributing Checklist

* After changing or adding a feature, make a corresponding test in `tests/test_response.py`

* Run the test suite with `python -m pytest tests/`; will require pytest module
