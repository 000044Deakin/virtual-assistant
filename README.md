# virtual-assistant
Text-based virtual assistant that tells you all you need to know (developed in Python 3.5)

## Usage
To run type

    python jerf.py

The first time you run it, it will ask for your username. Then you guys can talk and get to know each other.

## Prerequisites
You'll need the modules [lxml](http://lxml.de/installation.html) and [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/), for web scraping, and [pyenchant](http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/tutorial.html#installing-pyenchant) for spell checking.

# Contribution
You can contribute by opening issues and reporting bugs, and you can also help by making pull requests to improve or add new dialog and features. I welcome anything that could help make your virtual assistant better.

# Future Developments
In the future I plan to add updates such as
 - New and improved dialog and features
 - Add to and polish existing dialog and features
 - Bug fixes
 - Maybe some reorganizing to make things more readable
